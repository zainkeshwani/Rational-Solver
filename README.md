# Rational-Solver
Rational Function Solver coded in Java. I took AP Pre-Calculus in the 10th grade, where we learned all about rational functions in math. As such, I thought it would be a good idea to make a program that can simply give you all the information about the rational function. For example, my program will tell you the x and y intercepts of the function, simplify the rational and find all of its discontinuities (holes and vertial asymptotes), and much much more. All in all, this useful program helped me double check my work more often than not and also was a good way to practice applying my knowledge of Java to something useful in my everyday life.
